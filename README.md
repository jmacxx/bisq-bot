# compensation-bot
a bot to parse bisq compensation requests

Specification is here: https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues/32


## Configure settings
follow instructions for the `.env` file at https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#manually-configuring-a-github-app


## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Tools

`linter_tool.html` is a thin test harness for the linter.  It can be used for

- testing an individual compensation request
- running the linter test suite
- loading an existing compensation request from github to examine & test it


`reporting_tool.html` allows the end of cycle data to be analysed.  It works from a JSON data blob which can be obtained from a file, or generated by re-parsing all GitHub compensation reports.  
The cycle report outputs the following CSV reports:
- cycle issuance by team (in BSQ)
- cycle issuance by team (in USD)
- cycle issuance by team/user (in BSQ)
- cycle issuance by team/user (in USD)


`issuance.json` is the JSON blob used to store a record of parsed compensation reports.  Ideally it should be updated by a maintainer at each cycle end.  This is something that `reporting_tool` can help with.
